# Monty-Hall-Problem
This project is to prove my math teacher wrong. I wanted to make a bet with him for A's for everyone in the class but he did not want to do that D:

# What is The Monty Hall Problem
In the problem, you are on a game show, being asked to choose between three doors. Behind each door, there is either a car or a goat. You choose a door. The host, Monty Hall, picks one of the other doors, which he knows has a goat behind it, and opens it, showing you the goat. (You know, by the rules of the game, that Monty will always reveal a goat.) Monty then asks whether you would like to switch your choice of door to the other remaining door. Assuming you prefer having a car more than having a goat, do you choose to switch or not to switch?
